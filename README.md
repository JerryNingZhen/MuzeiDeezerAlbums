MuzeiDeezerAlbums
=================

Extension for using album covers  from Deezer as Muzei wallpapers. **This application can only work with the Muzei app (if you don't have it already, download it here [http://get.muzei.co][1]).**

To use this source, open the Muzei app settings and select Deezer as source (or check Deezer in the list of sources if you use MultiMuze).

This source will let you display albums : 

 - from Deezer's weekly selection, categorized by genres; 
 - from your own selection of album covers; 
 - from the last track you listen to with Deezer (if you don't have it, check it out here [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=deezer.android.app][2]);
 - from your favorite albums (requires you to log in). 

_Thank you +Roman Nurik for a wonderful and easily extensible app, and Deezer for their API._
